&lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
Allows to randomize your starting maps and geyser locations until you find something you like.
Every reroll has a cost- in the form of unmined resources from your map.

&lt;size=20&gt;How to use&lt;/size&gt;
Start a new game, or settle a new map. In the top right corner of the screen you will find a button with red dice. Click that.
Use "Reroll Map" to pick a new map from a list of previews, or "Reroll Geysers" to get random new geyser positions on the current map.
Each page of previews and geyser reroll operation will cost you an amount of unmined resources from the map- both the cost and the amount of remaining resources are displayed in the window.

The resource cost is optional, and can be disabled in the Options &gt; Mod Settings menu.
