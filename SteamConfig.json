	"description": "This mod allows you to quickly randomize your starting map and steam vents locations. Your starting scenario, colonists, items, etc. will all stay the same.\nNow includes the map preview generator- rather than trying for random maps, you can pick exactly the map you're looking for from a nearly limitless selection.\n\nOf course, there is a small price to pay- in the form of unmined resources from your map.\nThe resource cost is optional and can be disabled in the Options > Mod Options dialog.\n\n[b]Important:[/b] The HugsLib library mod must also be installed. Make sure both are enabled in the Mods menu and HugsLib is loaded first.\n\nThe in-game description contains a brief guide. To get more info, discuss features or provide feedback, please visit the official forum thread: \nhttps://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=18073\n\nHope you enjoy.\n\nMap Reroll works well with [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1194812929]Rainbeau's Configurable Maps[/url] mod.\n\nThe B19 version is still available and can be found here: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1535871514]Map Reroll (B19)[/url]\n\nMy other mods: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818773962]HugsLib[/url] · [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=818773962]Allow Tool[/url] · [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761219125]Defensive Positions[/url] · [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761379469]Remote Tech[/url]",
